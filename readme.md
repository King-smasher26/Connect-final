So, this is the website we developed (not complete yet) for upskill hackathon 2024.

Just do npm install in both server and client .
Start the server with nodemon ./server
and the client side with npm start.


Note:- you have to create a .env file in server and enter your ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET and DB for it to be working (you can use your own mongodb database and custom access-token).
